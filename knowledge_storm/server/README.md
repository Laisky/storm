    "article": "# summary\n\nBlack holes are some of the most fascinating and mysterious phenomena in the universe, defined by a gravitational force so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape their influence. They are typically categorized into three main types based on their mass: stellar black holes, which form from the remnants of massive stars; supermassive black holes, found at the centers of galaxies; and intermediate-mass black holes, which bridge the gap between the other two categories. A proposed fourth category, primordial black holes, is theorized to have formed in the early universe. The study of black holes is critical for understanding fundamental aspects of physics, including the nature of space and time, and the universe's evolution.\nThe growth of black holes is primarily attributed to two mechanisms: accretion of surrounding matter and mergers with other black holes. When a black hole attracts nearby material, it forms an accretion disk, where matter spirals inward, emitting radiation that can be detected across various wavelengths. Interestingly, as objects approach a black hole, time appears to slow down due to gravitational time dilation, creating the illusion that they never fully cross the event horizon from the perspective of distant observers. This phenomenon has significant implications for our understanding of black holes and raises questions about their role in the cosmos.\nControversies in black hole research revolve around their growth mechanisms and their relationship with dark energy, particularly in \"dead\" galaxies where supermassive black holes continue to grow despite a lack of available material. Some theories suggest that black holes might be interconnected with cosmic expansion, potentially influencing the dynamics of the universe. Furthermore, the challenges associated with directly observing black holes and their accretion processes have fueled ongoing debates about their nature and the laws governing their behavior.\nAs observational techniques and theoretical frameworks continue to evolve, the study of black holes remains a dynamic and vital area of astrophysical research, with implications that extend beyond astronomy and into the very fabric of physics itself.\n\n# The Nature of Black Holes\n\nBlack holes are among the most enigmatic objects in the universe, characterized by a gravitational pull so intense that not even light can escape their grasp. The boundary around a black hole, known as the event horizon, marks the point beyond which the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light, rendering any matter or radiation that crosses it permanently trapped[1]. Black holes can be categorized into three primary types based on their mass: stellar, supermassive, and intermediate-mass black holes, with a potential fourth category of primordial black holes proposed to exist from the early universe[2].\n\n## Types of Black Holes\n\n### Stellar Black Holes\n\nStellar black holes form from the remnants of massive stars that undergo gravitational collapse after exhausting their nuclear fuel. When such a star experiences a supernova explosion, the core collapses, leading to the creation of a black hole if the remaining mass exceeds a critical threshold (about three times that of the Sun)[3]. Typically, stellar black holes have masses ranging from three to around 100 solar masses and are found throughout the Milky Way galaxy[4].\n\n### Supermassive Black Holes\n\nSupermassive black holes, which reside at the centers of most large galaxies, including our own Milky Way, can possess masses ranging from hundreds of thousands to billions of solar masses[1]. The formation mechanisms of these colossal entities remain a topic of active research, with theories suggesting they may arise from direct collapse of massive gas clouds, mergers of smaller black holes, or rapid accretion of gas and dust in the early universe[3].\n\n### Intermediate-Mass Black Holes\n\nIntermediate-mass black holes, although rarer and less understood, are believed to bridge the gap between stellar and supermassive black holes, with masses ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of solar masses[2]. Their formation may involve the merging of stellar-mass black holes in dense environments or the direct collapse of gas clouds[3].\n\n## The Growth of Black Holes\n\nBlack holes grow primarily through a process known as accretion, where they attract and consume nearby matter, including gas from stars that venture too close[4]. This matter forms an accretion disk around the black hole, a swirling mass of gas that heats up and emits radiation across various wavelengths, making black holes detectable[5]. Additionally, black holes can grow by merging with other black holes, a process that contributes significantly to their mass over time[4].\nInterestingly, to an external observer, the process of an object falling into a black hole appears to unfold slowly due to the effects of time dilation. As the object approaches the event horizon, it seems to redshift and asymptotically approach the boundary without ever crossing it in any observable timeframe, leading to the illusion that the black hole does not consume anything at all[6]. This intriguing interplay of time and gravity exemplifies the complex nature of black holes and their profound implications for our understanding of the universe[5].\n\n# The Accretion Process\n\nAccretion is the process by which a massive central body, such as a black hole, accumulates matter from its surroundings, leading to significant increases in its mass and the emission of radiation. This process is primarily facilitated by the formation of an accretion disk, a structure formed by diffuse material in orbital motion around the central object. As matter falls towards the black hole, it cannot travel in a straight line due to its angular momentum; instead, it flattens into a disk shape as it spirals inward[7][8].\n\n## Formation of Accretion Disks\n\nAn accretion disk forms when the infalling matter possesses enough rotational momentum that prevents it from directly falling into the black hole. In directions perpendicular to the rotation axis, the matter tends to flatten due to this rotation. As it contracts toward the gravitational center, thermal pressure builds up, which resists further compression[7]. The disk's thickness depends on the balance between thermal pressure and gravitational forces; when thermal pressure is small relative to gravity, the disk becomes geometrically thin[7].\n\n## Energy Dynamics and Radiation\n\nAs matter spirals inward in an accretion disk, gravitational and frictional forces compress the material, increasing its temperature and leading to the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The emitted radiation spans a range of wavelengths, depending on the mass of the central object; for instance, disks around neutron stars and black holes emit X-rays due to their high temperatures, often reaching several million kelvins[7][9]. This radiation occurs because the process of accretion is extremely efficient in converting gravitational energy into thermal energy, making it roughly 30 times more effective than nuclear fusion in producing light and heat[9].\n\n## Accretion Rates and Disk Types\n\nThe behavior of an accretion disk can vary significantly based on the accretion rate. At high accretion rates, disks can be radiatively inefficient, where the energy produced exceeds the amount that can be radiated away, leading to the formation of powerful jets and significant luminosity[10]. Conversely, at low accretion rates, the disk may exhibit either a radiatively efficient state (thin disk) or a less efficient state (two-temperature state). The mechanisms triggering transitions between these states remain poorly understood but are evidenced in various astrophysical contexts, such as X-ray binaries[10].\n\n## Magnetic Fields and Jet Formation\n\nAccretion disks are often threaded by magnetic fields, which can be either advected from the interstellar medium or generated within the disk itself. Strong magnetic fields, on the order of hundreds of Gauss, are necessary for launching jets along the rotation axis of the disk[11]. However, challenges exist in maintaining these magnetic fields as they are carried inward; the magnetic field tends to diffuse away faster than the matter can accrete[11]. Effective modeling of these interactions is crucial for understanding the dynamics of accretion disks and their associated phenomena.\n\n# Growth of Black Holes\n\nThe growth of black holes, particularly supermassive black holes found at the centers of galaxies, remains a significant area of study in astrophysics. These colossal entities, which can have masses ranging from 1 million to 10 billion times that of the Sun, challenge our understanding of how they formed and evolved over the 14 billion years since the Big Bang[12][5].\n\n## Mechanisms of Growth\n\nAstrophysicists have proposed several mechanisms through which black holes can increase in mass. The two primary theories suggest that black holes grow either by accreting vast amounts of gas or by capturing and consuming stars. The former mechanism involves gas from the surrounding space falling into the black hole, forming an accretion disk. This disk is characterized by friction and magnetic forces, which heat the gas to high temperatures, causing it to emit powerful X-rays and radio waves detectable by astronomers[13][7].\nAnother intriguing aspect of black hole growth is the role of binary star systems. When a binary pair of stars orbits each other, the interaction with a black hole can be particularly effective. One of the stars can be ripped away and captured by the black hole, contributing to its growth without requiring the binary system to get very close to the black hole[12].\n\n## Accretion Processes\n\nGas falling toward a black hole is often organized into an accretion disk, a structure that facilitates the mass gain process. As material in the disk spirals inward, it loses energy and angular momentum, heating up and emitting electromagnetic radiation, particularly in the X-ray spectrum when near black holes[11]. In cases where the accretion rate is low, alternative models such as Advection-Dominated Accretion Flows (ADAFs) come into play, where the accretion is driven more by heat captured in matter rather than radiative cooling[14].\n\n## Challenges in Observing Growth\n\nAlthough researchers have identified various growth mechanisms, proving these theories requires more advanced observational tools. Scientists are particularly interested in detecting signatures of small stars being captured by supermassive black holes and the phenomenon of hypervelocity stars—stars that are ejected from galaxies at extremely high speeds after interactions with black holes[12]. The immense gravitational influence of supermassive black holes also creates complex dynamics in their surrounding environments, making direct observations challenging[5][13].\n\n# Theoretical Implications\n\nThe study of black holes raises profound questions about the nature of space, time, and matter, particularly regarding their growth mechanisms and their relationship with the Universe at large. A significant theoretical advancement in this area is the concept of **cosmological coupling**, which posits that black holes may grow in tandem with the expansion of the Universe. As astrophysicist Kevin Croker explains, if black holes contain dark energy, they could couple with the expanding Universe, potentially driving its acceleration.[15] This hypothesis suggests that black holes are not merely passive consumers of matter but may play an active role in shaping cosmic dynamics.\n\n## Black Holes in “Dead” Galaxies\n\nEmpirical evidence supporting cosmological coupling has emerged from observations of supermassive black holes residing in \"dead\" galaxies—galaxies that no longer produce stars and are devoid of significant material for black hole consumption. Surprisingly, these black holes continue to grow, which cannot be explained by conventional growth mechanisms.[15] This unexpected expansion implies that black holes might derive their growth from sources beyond their immediate surroundings, possibly linked to the broader cosmic expansion.\n\n## The Birth of Black Holes and Dark Energy\n\nFurther insights into black holes and their potential connection to dark energy arise from the process of black hole formation. As massive stars undergo gravitational collapse, researchers speculate that normal matter may be converted into dark energy during this process. This conversion could contribute to the overall dark energy present in the Universe, thereby linking the birth of black holes to the expansion of the cosmos.[15] Duncan Farrah, an astrophysicist, notes the consistency between the formation of new black holes and the increase of dark energy in the Universe, suggesting a profound interconnectedness between these phenomena.\n\n## Implications for the Missing Matter Problem\n\nThe exploration of black hole growth mechanisms also intersects with the longstanding **missing matter problem** in astrophysics. Various theories have been proposed to explain how supermassive black holes can exceed the conventional growth expectations based on their environments. While several ideas exist, none have yet established a definitive framework for understanding this phenomenon.[16] Concepts like the **complementarity principle** offer alternative perspectives on the nature of black holes and matter interaction, suggesting that matter falling into a black hole may be thermalized and emitted as Hawking radiation, thereby preserving information about its state.[17]\n\n## Quantum Gravity and Event Horizons\n\nTheoretical models concerning black holes often necessitate a comprehensive understanding of **quantum gravity**, which is essential for fully describing local event horizons and the behavior of matter near singularities.[18] Candidate theories, such as M-theory and loop quantum gravity, aim to reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity, particularly in extreme environments like those surrounding black holes. The implications of these theories extend beyond mere academic inquiry; they offer potential resolutions to some of the most fundamental questions in physics, including the fate of information swallowed by black holes and the true nature of spacetime near their singularities.[19]\n\n# Observational Techniques\n\nObservational techniques for studying black holes have evolved significantly with advancements in technology and instrumentation. Researchers are utilizing a variety of tools to gather data on black hole behavior, growth, and the surrounding cosmic environment.\n\n## Telescopes and Instruments\n\nNew observational instruments, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), are instrumental in measuring cosmic expansion and black hole growth rates. These tools aim to provide more precise data, enhancing our understanding of dark energy's influence on black holes and the universe at large[15]. Future space telescopes are expected to further facilitate these observations, allowing scientists to observe black holes and their accretion processes more directly.\n\n## Gravitational Wave Detectors\n\nGravitational wave observatories like LIGO and Virgo have revolutionized our understanding of black hole mergers. These detectors capture gravitational waves produced by colliding black holes, enabling researchers to infer properties such as the mass distribution of primordial black holes[8][11]. Upcoming gravitational wave detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), will probe the stochastic background of gravitational waves, providing insight into black hole populations and their interactions[8].\n\n## Imaging Techniques\n\nThe Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) represents a significant leap in observational capabilities, successfully capturing the first image of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way[20]. This array of radio observatories acts as a planet-sized telescope, allowing scientists to observe the shadow of a black hole against the backdrop of orbiting gas. The imaging technique capitalizes on the bending of light due to the intense gravitational field of black holes, thus providing visual evidence of their existence.\n\n## The Role of Simulations\n\nHigh-performance computing plays a critical role in modeling black hole behavior and accretion flows. For example, simulations run on supercomputers, like those conducted by researchers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, help in understanding the complex dynamics of accretion disks around black holes. These simulations reveal how energy is released and how magnetic fields may interact with the accretion processes[10][18].\n\n## Future Directions\n\nAs observational techniques continue to advance, scientists expect to gather more data that could lead to a deeper understanding of black hole growth and the nature of the universe. New proposed experiments, including MeV gamma-ray telescopes and wide-field gamma-ray observatories, aim to explore previously uncharted aspects of black hole physics, such as primordial black holes and their contributions to gravitational waves and cosmic structure[8].",

                "description": "The Universe is growing. And not just at a steady pace—it’s expanding faster and faster. For decades, scientists have struggled to understand the mysterious force behind this accelerated expansion, often attributing it to something called dark energy. Now, however, new research suggests that black holes, those enigmatic cosmic giants, could be contributing to this growth",
                "snippets": [
                    "The concept of cosmological coupling is groundbreaking. Imagine the expansion of the Universe being directly connected to the growth of black holes. This means that as the Universe expands, so do black holes—suggesting an intimate link between these dense matter concentrations and the cosmic landscape around them. According to this theory, black holes don’t just consume matter; they grow in sync with the Universe’s expansion.\nKevin Croker, an astrophysicist from Arizona State University, explains that “if black holes contain dark energy, they can couple to and grow with the expanding Universe, causing its growth to accelerate.” The math behind this coupling suggests that black holes could be more than just cosmic endpoints for stars; they might be engines driving the expansion of the Universe.\nEvidence: Growth of Black Holes in “Dead” Galaxies",
                    "While the theory is enticing, it’s still in its early stages. To transform it from an intriguing idea into accepted science, more observational data and experiments are needed. Croker, Farrah, and their teams are now looking to test their predictions with more powerful telescopes and instruments, aiming to observe these processes in action. As Tarlé, a physicist at the University of Michigan, puts it, “This is an experimental question now.”\nNew tools such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and upcoming space telescopes will enable scientists to gather more precise data on black hole growth rates, cosmic expansion, and dark energy’s role in the process. If the data continues to support cosmological coupling, we might soon have a much clearer picture of the Universe’s fate.\nConclusion: A New Perspective on the Universe’s Fate",
                    "The cosmological coupling theory also provides insights into how black holes might be connected to dark energy right from their formation. As massive stars reach the end of their life cycles, they undergo gravitational collapse, forming black holes. Researchers suggest that during this collapse, normal matter might be converted into dark energy within black holes. This transformation could add dark energy to the Universe, supporting the theory that black holes contribute directly to cosmic expansion.\nAstrophysicist Duncan Farrah from the University of Hawai’i notes, “The two phenomena were consistent with each other – as new black holes were made in the deaths of massive stars, the amount of dark energy in the Universe increased in the right way.” This connection, if verified, could help explain why black holes seem to influence the Universe on such an immense scale.\nImplications for the Missing Matter Problem",
                    "One of the first pieces of evidence for cosmological coupling came from studying supermassive black holes within “dead” galaxies. These galaxies no longer produce stars, and their black holes are starved of fuel. Under normal conditions, black holes in such galaxies should stop growing once their host galaxies run out of resources. However, scientists found that these black holes were still expanding, and the increase could not be attributed to any known growth mechanism. This surprising observation supports the idea that black holes could grow in ways unrelated to nearby material consumption—possibly through coupling with the Universe’s expansion.\nThe Birth of Black Holes and Dark Energy"

It was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), an array which links together eight existing radio observatories across the planet to form a single Earth-sized virtual telescope. The telescope is named after the \"event horizon\", the boundary of the black hole beyond which no light can escape.\nAlthough we cannot see the event horizon itself, because it cannot emit light, glowing gas orbiting around the black hole reveals a telltale signature: a dark central region, called a \"shadow,\" surrounded by a bright ring-like structure. The new view captures light bent by the powerful gravity of the black hole, which is 4 million times more massive than our sun. The image of the Sgr A* black hole is an average of the different images that the EHT Collaboration has extracted from its 2017 observations.",

The central body is most frequently a star. Friction, uneven irradiance, magnetohydrodynamic effects, and other forces induce instabilities causing orbiting material in the disk to spiral inward toward the central body. Gravitational and frictional forces compress and raise the temperature of the material, causing the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The frequency range of that radiation depends on the central object's mass.

Magnetic fields strengths at least of order 100 Gauss seem necessary for the magneto-centrifugal mechanism to launch powerful jets. There are problems, however, in carrying external magnetic flux inward toward the central star of the disk. High electric conductivity dictates that the magnetic field is frozen into the matter which is being accreted onto the central object with a slow velocity. However, the plasma is not a perfect electric conductor, so there is always some degree of dissipation. The magnetic field diffuses away faster than the rate at which it is being carried inward by accretion of matter. A simple solution is assuming a viscosity much larger than the magnetic diffusivity in the disk"

Far from the black hole where the angular momentum is close to the Keplerian value, the dissipation rate is three times the local rate of energy liberation because two-thirds of the dissipated energy is transported from closer in by the same torques that transport angular momentum outward. Overall energy conservation is maintained because the dissipation rate close to the ISCO is lower than the local rate at which energy is liberated. This means that the outer parts of an accretion disk will accumulate internal energy and becomes unbound unless at least two-thirds of the dissipated energy is radiated away.",

                    "Thus, accretion flows with high accretion rates are radiatively inefficient because they liberate more energy than they can radiate, but they are also very luminous because they radiate at close to the Eddington limit. Such flows are strongly dominated by radiation pressure and should be modeled using an adiabatic index of 4/3.",
                    "The presumption for disklike flows is that the accretion rate adjusts itself so that the circulation, outflow, convection — or whatever it is that relieves the energy crisis — is able to carry away any accretion energy that isn't lost to radiation. This is possible because the radial density and pressure gradients are rather flat, giving the outer flow a high \"carrying capacity\" for excess energy, compared to the inner flow where most of this energy is liberated. But this presumption fails in the case of starlike accretion flows, where the density and pressure profiles are forced to steepen in order to keep the gas bound while satisfying dynamical constraints. This means that matter is more centrally concentrated around the black hole in a starlike flow, and if this matter is swallowed with an energy efficiency typical for the ISCO it will liberate much more energy than can be carried away by the outer parts of the flow."

It was a mistake.\nSuppose you are distant and stationary relative to the black hole. You will observe infalling matter asymptotically approaching the horizon, growing ever fainter as it redshifts. Does it mean that matter \"clumps\" around the horizon? To find out, suppose you throw yourself towards the black hole to try to catch the matter that you see. What you will find is that it fell into the black hole long ago.\nIn other words, the most sensible way to answer whether or not infalling matter clumps on the horizon is to look at the situation from the frame of that infalling matter. And there, it is clear: no, it does not clump, as it crosses the horizon in finite proper time.

                    "- Formation: Researchers are currently attempting to determine the precise process of forming supermassive black holes. Several theories have been put forth, such as the direct collapse of massive gas clouds, the merger of smaller black holes, and the fast accretion of gas and dust in the early universe. Supermassive black holes may form as a result of any one of these processes.\n- Observation: The predominant method of observing supermassive black holes is through their gravitational pull on nearby matter. This includes the stars’ and gas clouds’ high velocities in the vicinity of the galactic centre, which point to the existence of a massive central object. Furthermore, the powerful radiation from the accretion disk—the material falling into the black hole—can be observed at various wavelengths, including radio, ultraviolet, optical, and X-rays.",
                    "- Observation: Identifying intermediate-mass black holes presents a challenge due to their rarity and difficulty distinguishing them from other astronomical phenomena. They are typically observed indirectly through their gravitational effects on surrounding matter, such as stars and gas clouds. Some potential candidates for intermediate-mass black holes have been identified in globular clusters, dwarf galaxies, and active star-forming regions.\n- Role in Galaxy Evolution: The growth mechanisms of supermassive black holes and their role in galaxy evolution may be clarified by studying intermediate-mass black holes, which is why they are of special interest.\nPrimordial Black Holes\nImage credit: NASA/ESA and G. Bacon (STScI)",
                    "- Formation: Massive stars collapse gravitationally to form stellar black holes. When a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer support its own weight against gravitational collapse. A supernova explosion occurs when the star’s core collapses quickly, causing the remaining material to collapse even more and form a compact object. If the core’s mass is above a certain threshold (about three times the mass of the Sun), it collapses into a black hole.\n- Size: Stellar black holes are smaller than supermassive black holes. They are located in the centres of galaxies and typically have masses ranging from about 3 to 100 times that of the Sun. Their corresponding size can be just a few kilometres in diameter.\n- Event Horizon: Stellar black holes, like all other black holes, have an event horizon beyond which nothing can escape—not even light.

It’s possible that intermediate-mass black holes are a stage between supermassive black hole development and development.\n- Size and Mass: Intermediate-mass black holes can have masses hundreds to tens of thousands of times greater than the Sun.
